## Skipped/incomplete files

These are files that we're skipping for now and will come back to later, as time allows.
There's also files that are incomplete as they depend on other files.

* `Sound`
* `SoundModule`
* `SoundWaveGenerator`
* `ProgramLoader`
  * Uses `Mips`, so `Mips` (along with whatever `Mips` uses) probably needs to be done first.
* `Program`
  * Mostly done, but it uses `Mips` and `ProgramLoader`, so those need to be done.
