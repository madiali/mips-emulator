## Skipped/incomplete files

These are files that we're skipping for now and will come back to later, as time allows.
There's also files that are incomplete as they depend on other files.

* `Sound`
* `SoundModule`
* `SoundWaveGenerator`
* `ProgramLoader`
  * Once Sound is implemented, there needs to be a small change in this file
  * And Sound also needs to go in MemoryUnitFactory when implemented, do not forget about this
