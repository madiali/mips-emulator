## Skipped/incomplete files

These are files that we're skipping for now and will come back to later, as time allows.
There's also files that are incomplete as they depend on other files.

* `Sound`
* `SoundModule`
* `SoundWaveGenerator`
* `AccelerometerController`
  * Handle the case when the accelerometer isn't in the JSON; check for AccelerometerX and AccelerometerY
* `VgaDisplayBMPController`
  * Handle parameteriztion, 32x32 and 64x64 sprites
  * Put BMP methods into a separate file
