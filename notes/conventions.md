# Code conventions

Generally, we follow [Google's style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

### Jesse

* I do not `_` before field names (though it's my personal preference) and use `this` instead.
* I use optional braces after an if/else/while even if the body is only one line, following the style guide.
